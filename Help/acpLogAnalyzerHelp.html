				<h3>An Overview of ACP Log Analyzer</h3>
				<div>
                    <p>
                        The ACP Log Analyzer app provides a quick and easy mechanism for generating an informational report on your ACP-based observing 
                        activities. This can be for the previous evening, the last month, or as long as you've been using ACP (and have the log files 
                        related to your observing sessions).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ACP Log Analyzer makes it easy to find out, for example, what your average pointing error is when slewing to objects, what your
                        average FWHM is, how many plate solves failed, how many times an auto-focus run succeeded/failed, etc. This can be done for 
                        a single log or for many hundreds, and you can view summarized information about each log and/or overall results for the entire
                        set of log files. And ACP Log Analyzer works quickly too, normally completing in a few seconds or less, even when parsing
                        several hundred logs.
                    </p>

                <h3>Will it damage my logs?!</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        No, ACP Log Analyzer simply <em>reads</em> the contents of one or more of your ACP logs (which are just text files with a .log extension), 
                        analyzes the text and outputs a summary of the information found. At no time is the contents of any log file altered.

                <h3>How to install ACP Log Analyzer</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        ACP Log Analyzer uses a standard Windows installer to install the application. Simply 
                        <a href="_files/ACPLogAnalyzerSetup.msi">download</a> the latest version of the installer (ACPLogAnalyzerSetup.msi) and save it 
                        to a temporary location on your hard disk. Double-click the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
                    </p>

					</a>
                    <p></p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When installation is complete, a new folder containing a link to launch the ACP Log Analyzer will have been created in your 
                        <em>Start | All Programs</em> menu:
                    </p>

                <h3>How to remove ACP Log Analyzer</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        To remove the application, use the Windows Control Panel (e.g. <em>Programs &amp; Features</em> in Windows 7) to uninstall the
                        application.
                    </p>

                <h3>How to use ACP Log Analyzer</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        When you first run the application you'll see the following:
                    </p>
                    
                    <a href="_images/la01.png" class="lightbox" title="ACP Log Analyzer - First-run appearance">
						<img class="floatCenter" src="_images/la01sm.png" />
					</a>
                    <p></p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The first thing to do is tell ACP Log Analyzer which logs to work on. This can be done in a number of ways.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	The first way is to <em>Drag &amp; Drop</em> one or more files and/or folders from Windows Explorer into the <em>Logs</em> list:
                    </p>

                    <a href="_images/la05.png" class="lightbox" title="ACP Log Analyzer - Drag 'n' Drop files">
						<img class="floatCenter" src="_images/la05sm.png" />
					</a>
                    <p></p>
                                
                    <p>
                    	Another alternative is to click the <strong>Add Single Log</strong> button. This allows you to select a single log file.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>
                    	You may also click the <strong>Add All Logs In Path</strong> button. In this case, ACP Log Analyzer will search the folder 
                        structure specified in the path bar for ACP logs. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    	Note that whatever method you choose, all logs are briefly examined to determine if they are valid ACP logs (lots of applications
                        produce logs with a .log extension). Non-ACP logs are rejected.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	The contents of a log may be viewed in your default text editor (e.g. Notepad.exe) by <em>double-clicking</em> either the log contents
                        window, or, by double-clicking any item in the list of logs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    	If required, you may remove a log from the list by right-clicking it, and then selecting <strong>Remove log from list</strong> 
                        from the popup menu:
                    </p>

                        You are now ready to create a report - <strong>simply <em>select</em> (click on) a log in the list</strong> or click the 
                        <strong>Generate Report On All Logs</strong> button. Whatever method you choose, the report appears in the right-most

                    <p>
                        Log Analyzer allows you to generate 22 different types of graph that plot data points for key observing activities.<br />
                        Simply select the required graph type and click <strong>Plot</strong>:

                    <p>
                        The graph appears in a floating window, which you can move and resize as required. If you resize the window the 
                        graph will rescale to take maximum advantage of available space. When you are finished reviewing the graph you 
                        may either close the window or leave it open (perhaps to compare with another graph - you may have as many
                        graph windows open as you like):

				<div>
					<p><strong>Version 1.32 (01 January 2013)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Support for All-Sky plate solves (new in ACP 7)</strong><br />
							Added support for the new all-sky plate solve feature added in ACP 7. <br />
							New reporting and graphing features introduced as follows:<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Report on overall count of successful all-sky plate solves</li>
								<li>Report on overall count of unsuccessful all-sky plate solves</li>
								<li>Report on per-target count of successful all-sky plate solves</li>
								<li>Report on per-target count of unsuccessful all-sky plate solves</li>
								<li>Plot of all-sky plate solve times for the current log</li>                
								<li>Plot of average times for successful all-sky plate solves for all logs</li>              
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							Adjusted log parsing logic so that:<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Pointing errors during the all-sky pate solve process are ignored (because they are unrepresentative)</li>
								<li>Pointing errors immediately following a successful all-sky pate solve are inlcuded</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							Application preference settings to include/exclude the new reporting options have been added to the Configure Report window 
						</li>
						<p></p>
			 
						<li>
							<strong>Moved source to Visual Studio 2012</strong><br />
							This has no impact on application features 
						</li>
						<p></p>
						   
						<li>
							<strong>New installer</strong><br />
							Forced to introduce a new third-party (InstallShield 2012 LE) installer as Visual Studio 2012 no longer provides setup projects
						</li>
						<p></p>    
		
						<li>
							<strong>Code clean-up</strong><br />
							Many changes to clean-up and standardize code (following inspection and code analysis with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a>). 
							This has no impact on application features
						</li>      
						<p></p>                             	
		
						<li>
							<strong>Bug fix:</strong><br />
							Fixed a bug where attempting to select a 'non-selectable' graph plot option caused subsequent valid selections not to output a valid graph
						</li>
						<p></p>    
		
						<li>
							<strong>Minor changes to Auto-Update logic</strong><br />
							The auto-update feature now downloads updates to the user's Desktop (previously it was a hard-to-find temporary folder)
						</li>
						<p></p>             
					</ul>
					<p></p>
	
					<p><strong>Version 1.31 (05 April 2012)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Bug fix:</strong><br />
							Fixed a bug where clicking the 'Add Single Log' button without having previously selected a path caused the application to stop responding
						</li>
						<p></p>
				   
						<li>
							<strong>Bug fix:</strong><br />
							Fixed a system-wide bug related to the timing of operations which spanned the midnight 'time-flip'. This resulted in the time-span for some operations
							being assigned a negative value
						</li>
						<p></p>   
		
					  <li>
							<strong>Bug fix:</strong><br />
						  Fixed a bug where the text report was showing  total imaging time, rather than the individual imaging target totals
					  </li>
						<p></p>  
		
					  <li>
							<strong>Deployment server change</strong><br />
						  Made changes to reflect the fact that the application is now served from http://www.rarcher.net
					  </li> 
						<p></p>                                          	
					</ul>
					<p></p>
	
					<p><strong>Version 1.30 (13 February 2012)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Bug fix:</strong><br />
							Fixed an issue where some measurements (e.g. guider settle time) that happen instantly (take zero seconds to complete) were
							not being recorded for either text reports or graphs. Such measurements are now being correctly reported and graphed
						</li>
						<p></p>
										
					</ul>
					<p></p>

					<p><strong>Version 1.29 (07 December 2011)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Bug fix:</strong><br />
							Fixed minor issue with <em>Slew (to target) time</em>. We now ignore rare instances where the slew starts but
							ACP doesn't report the slew end time. These instances are detected by looking for pointing updates, re-slews to targets
							or starting slews to other targets
						</li>
						<p></p>
		
						<li>
							<strong>Internal code refactoring:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Split the Log class into a partial class, spread over two files (the log parsing methods were split out)</li>
								<li>Split the ParseLog() method so that each log event's processing was refactored into distinct methods (was in one large method)</li>
								<li>Reworked all the average, sum, etc. type methods/getters to use the built-in .NET Average, Sum, etc. extension methods</li>
								<li>Refactored enumerations of properties where possible with LINQ expressions</li>
								<li>Refactored log properties to use on-demand calculated values (previously used cached private members exposed by getters)</li>
								<li>Refactored report, again by using LINQ to query log data and eliminate duplicated data</li>
								<li>Numerous other changes to clean, simplify and improve code quality</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<p></p>
										
					</ul>
					<p></p>
	
					<p><strong>Version 1.28 (23 November 2011)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Clicking on a graph data-point now scrolls the log</strong><br />
							Clicking on any data-point (except the average line) scrolls the log contents window to highlight
							the relevant event in the log. This only works for "currently selected log" graphs
						</li>
						<p></p>
										
					</ul>
					<p></p>
	
					<p><strong>Version 1.27 (22 November 2011)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>FWHM v HFD graphs now have two independent axes</strong><br />
							FWHM v HFD comparision graphs now show the two data sets on independent (overlaid) axes. This means that both FWHM and HFD
							data points now show the correct dates/times
						</li>
						<p></p>
		
						<li>
							<strong>Graph export feature updated to support tertiary data series</strong><br />
							Updated graph data export feature to export third data series (if present)

						</li>
						<p></p>
		
						<li>
							<strong>FWHM measurements now ignore pointing updates</strong><br />
							FWHM measurements now only include data for successful plate-solves on imaging targets (e.g. pointing update FWHM's are ignored)
						</li> 
						<p></p>
		
						<li>
							<strong>Added HFD measurements</strong><br />
							Added reporting of HFD measurements (as reported by FocusMax) for both the selected log and for all logs.

						</li> 
						<p></p>        
				
						<li>
							<strong>Added graphs for FWHM v HFD</strong><br />
							Added two new graphs to compare FWHM and HFD. Note that to facilitate easier comparision, the HFD data is fitted 
							to the timescale used by the FWHM data (i.e. the HFD datapoints are not shown at their 'correct' times)
						</li> 
						<p></p>
						
						<li>
							<strong>Added graphs for auto-focus times</strong><br />
							Added two new graphs to show auto-focus times for the selected log, and average auto-focus times for all logs
